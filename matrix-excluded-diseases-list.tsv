Clinically it is divided into the following types: nodular, ulcerative, superficial, multicentric, erythematous, and sclerosing or morphea-like. More than 95% of these carcinomas occur in patients over 40. They develop on hair-bearing skin, most commonly on sun-exposed areas. Approximately 85% are found on the head and neck and the remaining 15% on the trunk and extremities. Basal cell carcinoma usually grows in a slow and indolent fashion. However, if untreated, the tumor may invade the subcutaneous fat, skeletal muscle and bone. Distant metastases are rare.

MONDO:0005960	silicosis	Silicosis is a respiratory disease caused by breathing in (inhaling) silica dust. There are three types of silicosis: Simple chronic silicosis, the most common type of silicosis, results from long-term exposure (usually more than 20years) to low amounts of silica dust. Simple chronic silicosismay causepeople to have difficulty breathing. Accelerated silicosis occurs after 5 to 15 yearsof exposure of higher levels of silica.Swelling of the lungsand other symptoms occur faster in this type of silicosis than in the simple chronic form. Acute silicosis results from short-term exposure (weeks or months) of large amounts of silica.The lungs become very inflamed and can fill with fluid, causing severe shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels. A cough, weight loss, and fatigue may also be present. Acute silicosis progresses rapidly and can be fatal within months. People who work in jobs where they are exposed to silica dust (mining, quarrying, construction, sand blasting, stone cutting) are at risk of developing this condition.	silicosis, silica pneumoconiosis, silicotic fibrosis of lung, pneumoconiosis due to silicates, pneumoconiosis due to silica	mondo:gard_rare, mondo:nord_rare, mondo:otar, mondo:rare

The autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that regulates certain involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder control. Orthostatic hypotension is a form of low blood pressure that happens when standing-up from sitting or lying down. Common symptoms may include dizziness, lightheadedness, generalized weakness, leg buckling, nausea, blurry vision, fatigue, and headaches. Additional symptoms can include chest pain (angina), head and neck pain (often affecting neck and shoulders with a coat hanger distribution), decline in cognitive functioning such as difficulty concentrating, temporary loss of consciousness or “blackout”. Some people with primary orthostatic hypotension may also have high blood pressure when lying down.

MONDO:0017010	partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome X	Chromosome Xq duplication is a chromosome abnormality that affects many different parts of the body. People with this condition have an extra copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of the X chromosome in each cell. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary based on the size and location of theduplication;the genes involved; and the sex of the affected person. In general, males are typically more severely affected than females and often experience intellectual disability, developmental delay, short stature, abnormalities of the reproductive organs, anddistinctive craniofacial features. Many females with this duplication do not have any symptoms or are only affected with short stature; however, some may be just as severely affected as males with the condition.

However, this description includes several inflammatory cutaneous diseases that are unrelated with respect to pathogenesis, histopathology, and response to treatment. Because of the variation in clinical presentation and a lack of a specific diagnostic finding on histopathology, a uniformly accepted definition of parapsoriasis remains lacking. There are 2 general forms: a small plaque type, which is usually benign, and a large plaque type, which is a precursor of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).Treatment of small plaque parapsoriasis is unnecessary but can include emollients, topical tar preparations or corticosteroids, and/or phototherapy. Treatment of large plaque parapsoriasis is phototherapy or topical corticosteroids.		mondo:otar	ICD10CM:L41

Less than 1 % of neoplasms are associated with these syndromes. An immune-mediated response to neoplasm-elaborated proteins may be the cause of these syndromes. Additionally, their manifestation may signal the presence of an occult neoplasm, potentially at an earlier stage of disease thereby leading to a better clinical outcome. Constitutional signs may include fever, night sweats, anorexia and cachexia. Clinical course is usually progressive.

HPIV-3 can also cause bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Infants and young children are particularly susceptible to HPIV-3 infections, though older adults and those with a weakened immune system are also at risk for complications. HPIVs are usually spread from an infected person to others through coughing, sneezing, and/or touching. There is currently no vaccine to protect against parainfluenza virus infections. Most HPIV infections resolve on their own and do not require special treatment, though medical intervention may be necessary for severe breathing problems.

MONDO:0100283	overgrowth syndrome and/or cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR pathway genes	A disease caused by mosaic gain-of-function (GoF) of several genes in the MTOR pathway (MTOR, PIK3CA, PIK3R2 and AKT3) are functionally the same despite significant phenotypic variability. These GoF variants result in overgrowth due to an over-activation of key genes in this pathway. The phenotypic variability is generally attributed to the mosaic fraction and affected tissue types. For example, macrocephaly is noted if the variant is identified in the brain, but non symmetric overgrowth of that limb is noted when the variant is only present in the affected limb. The pathologies of the affected tissue often reveal similar characteristics such as cellular overgrowth. However, this is not always the case especially with focal cortical dysplasia. At times the characteristics pathologies are not present in the tissue but sampling biases are an issue. FCD resections often involve a very small area and so a very small amount of tissue is available for pathology and it is not guaranteed that lesional tissue is sent. Therefore, having a single disease term which can encompass the phenotypic variability yet provide a unifying molecular diagnosis name makes sense given the common functional mechanism.	overgrowth syndrome and/or cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR pathway genes	mondo:rare, mondo:clingen, mondo:gard_rare, mondo:otar

It may be caused by use of certain medications or supplements, infection, or any condition that leads to high levels of calcium in the blood or urine including hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, Alport syndrome, Bartter syndrome,and a variety of other conditions. Some of the underlying disorders that can cause nephrocalcinosis are genetic, with the inheritance pattern depending on the specific disorder. Treatment differs depending on the cause of nephrocalcinosis and often aims to prevent more calcium from being deposited in the kidneys.		mondo:otar

MONDO:0018634	hereditary amyloidosis	Hereditary amyloidosis refers to a group of inherited conditions that make up one of the subtypes of amyloidosis. Hereditary amyloidosisis characterized by the deposit of an abnormal protein called amyloid in multiple organs of the body where it should not be, which causes disruption of organ tissue structure and function. In hereditary amyloidosis, amyloid deposits most often occur in tissues of the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. While symptoms of hereditary amyloidosis may appear in childhood, most individuals do not experience symptoms until adulthood. There are many types of hereditary amyloidosis associated with different gene mutations and abnormal proteins. The most common type of hereditary amyloidosis is transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR),a condition in which the amyloid deposits are most often made up of the transthyretin protein which is made in the liver. Other examplesof hereditary amyloidosis include, but are not limited to, apolipoprotein AI amyloidosis (A ApoAI), gelsolin amyloidosis (A Gel), lysozyme amyloidosis (A Lys), cystatin C amyloidosis (A Cys), fibrinogen Aα-chain amyloidosis (A Fib), and apolipoprotein AII amyloidosis (A ApoAII). Most types of hereditary amyloidosis are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is focused on addressing symptoms of organ damage and slowing down the production of amyloid when possible through methods such as liver transplants.	hereditary amyloidosis (disease), amyloidosis, Familial	mondo:disease_grouping, mondo:otar, mondo:rare, mondo:nord_rare, mondo:gard_rare, mondo:ordo_group_of_disorders

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.	carcinoma, hepatocellular, malignant, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, somatic, hepatocellular adenocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma, somatic, primary carcinoma of liver cells, liver carcinoma, hepatoma, liver cell cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), primary carcinoma of the liver cells, hepatocellular carcinoma, childhood type, somatic, hepatocellular cancer, somatic, carcinoma of the liver cells, liver cell carcinoma, hepatocellular cancer, cancer, hepatocellular, HCC, carcinoma of liver cells, carcinoma of liver	mondo:gard_rare, mondo:nord_rare, mondo:ordo_group_of_disorders, mondo:rare, mondo:otar

MONDO:0023305	heavy metal poisoning	Heavy metal poisoning refers to when excessive exposure to a heavy metal affects the normal function of the body. Examples of heavy metals that can cause toxicity include lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. Exposure may occur through the diet, from medications, from the environment, or in the course of work or play. Heavy metals can enter the body through the skin, or by inhalation or ingestion. Toxicity can result from sudden, severe exposure, or from chronic exposure over time. Symptoms can vary depending on the metal involved, the amount absorbed, and the age of the person exposed. For example, young children are more susceptible to the effects of lead exposure because they absorb more compared with adults and their brains are still developing. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common symptoms of acute metal ingestion. Chronic exposure may cause various symptoms resulting from damage to body organs, and may increase the risk of cancer. Treatment depends on the circumstances of the exposure.	toxic effect of heavy metal, heavy metal poisoning	mondo:rare, mondo:nord_rare, mondo:otar, mondo:gard_rare

There are four main types of epidermolysis bullosa: dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa Epidermolysis bullosa simplex Junctional epidermolysis bullosa Kindler Syndrome Identifying the exact type can be hard because there are many subtypes of EB. Within each type or subtype, a person may be mildly or severely affected. The disease can range from being a minor inconvenience to completely disabling, and fatal in some cases. Most types of EB are inherited. The inheritance pattern may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive.

MONDO:0023076	eosinophilic pustular folliculitis	Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) is a skin disorder characterized by recurring itchy, red or skin-colored bumps and pustules (bumps containing pus). The condition is named after the fact that skin biopsies of this disorder find eosinophils (a type of immune cell) around hair follicles. The papules mostly appear on the face, scalp, neck and trunk and may persist for weeks or months. EPF affects males more than females.There are several variants of EPF includingclassic eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (mainly occurring in adults in Japan); HIV-associated EPF, also referred to as immunosuppression-associated EPF; and infantile EPF (with onset from birth or within the first year of life). Whether these are distinct disorders rather than variants of one disorder is controversial, partly because the underlying cause of EFP is not known.Several treatments have been described with variable results, including various oral or topical medications and phototherapy. In patients with HIV-associated disease, antiretroviral therapy tends to greatly diminish symptoms or even eliminate the condition.		mondo:gard_rare, mondo:nord_rare, mondo:rare

An extra full copy of chromosome 20 in all of a person's cells is rare, and almost all fetuses with this do not survive past the first trimester ofpregnancy. The presence of an extra copyof only part of chromosome 20 is called partial trisomy 20; and an extra copy of chromosome 20 in only some of a person's cells is called mosaic trisomy 20. Mosaic trisomy 20 is the most common type of chromosome 20 trisomy and is one of the more common chromosomal abnormalities found during prenatal diagnostic testing. Studies have shown that the child is normal in the vast majority of prenatally diagnosed individuals. However, features that have been reported include spinal abnormalities (including spinal stenosis, vertebral fusion, and kyphosis), hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), life long constipation, sloped shoulders, and significant learning disabilities despite normal intelligence. Trisomy 20 usually results from an error that occurs when an egg or sperm cell develops (before fertilization); mosaic trisomy 20 usually results from errors in cell division soon after fertilization.		mondo:rare, mondo:gard_rare

The urachus is a structure normally only present during development in the womb that connects the bellybutton and the bladder. This connection normally disappears before birth, but in some people remains. Urachalcancers are usually diagnosed in adults in their 50's and 60's and may develop at the dome or anterior wall of the bladder, along the midline of the body (including the belly button), and between the pubis symphasis and the bladder.Most urachal cancersare adenocarcinomas (cancers that develop from gland cells).Others may besarcomas (which develop from connective tissue -such as leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma), small cell carcinomas, transitional cell cancer, and mixed neoplasias. Most individuals with urachal cancer have symptoms of with hematuria (blood in urine). Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, mucinuria, and bacteriuria.

MONDO:0006676	beriberi	Beriberi is a condition that occurs in people who are deficient in thiamine (vitamin B1). There are two major types of beriberi: wet beriberi which affects the cardiovascular system and dry beriberi which affects the nervous system. People with wet beriberi may experience increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and swelling of the lower legs. Signs and symptoms of dry beriberi include difficulty walking; loss of feeling in the hands and/or feet; paralysis of the lower legs; mental confusion; speech difficulty; pain; and/or vomiting. Beriberi is rare in the United States since many foods are now vitamin enriched; however, alcohol abuse, dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics increases the risk of developing the condition. In most cases,beriberi occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. A rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families) and is associated with an inability to absorb thiamine from foods. Treatment generally includes thiamine supplementation, given by injection or taken by mouth.	vitamin B1 deficiency, Beri Beri, thiamine deficiency	mondo:otar

MONDO:0019696	acromesomelic dysplasia	A group of extremely rare, inherited, progressive skeletal conditions that result in a particular form of short stature, called short-limb dwarfism. The short stature is the result of unusually short forearms and forelegs (mesomelia) and abnormal shortening of the bones in the hands and feet (acromelia). At birth, the hands and feet may appear abnormally short and broad. Over time, the apparent disproportion becomes even more obvious, especially during the first years of life. Additional features may include: limited extension of the elbows and arms; progressive abnormal curvature of the spine; an enlarged head; and a slightly flattened midface. Acromesomelic dysplasia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. There are different types of acromesomelic dysplasia, which are distinguished by their genetic cause.

MONDO:0010198	Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome	Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a brain disorder, due to thiamine deficiency that has been associated with both Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. The term refers to two different syndromes, each representing a different stage of the disease. Wernicke's encephalopathy represents the 'acute' phase and Korsakoff's syndrome represents the 'chronic' phase. However, they are used interchangeable in many sites. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, abnormal stance and gait (ataxia), and abnormal eye movements (nystagmus). Korsakoff's syndrome is observed in a small number of patients. It is a type of dementia, characterized by memory loss and confabulation (filling in of memory gaps with data the patient can readily recall) and involvement of the heart, vascular, and nervous system. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome mainly results from chronic alcohol use, but also from dietary deficiencies, prolonged vomiting, eating disorders, systemic diseases (cancer, AIDS, infections), bariatric surgery, transplants, or the effects of chemotherapy. Studies indicate that there may be some genetic predisposition for the disease.Treatment involves supplementing the diet with thiamine. Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute syndrome and requires emergency treatment to prevent death and neurologic complications. In cases where the diagnosis is not confirmed, patients should still be treated while additional evaluations are completed.

MONDO:0700247	RAB18 deficiency	Group of diseases encompassing a spectrum of disorders characterized by Warburg Micro Syndrome (characterized by eye, nervous system, and endocrine abnormalities) and Martsolf Syndrome phenotypes (characterized by similar – but milder – findings). To date Warburg micro syndrome comprises 96% of reported individuals with genetically defined RAB18 deficiency. The hallmark ophthalmologic findings are bilateral congenital cataracts, usually accompanied by microphthalmia, microcornea (diameter <10), and small atonic pupils. Poor vision despite early cataract surgery likely results from progressive optic atrophy and cortical visual impairment. Individuals with Warburg micro syndrome have severe to profound intellectual disability (ID); those with Martsolf syndrome have mild to moderate ID. Some individuals with RAB18 deficiency also have epilepsy. In Warburg micro syndrome, a progressive ascending spastic paraplegia typically begins with spastic diplegia and contractures during the first year, followed by upper-limb involvement leading to spastic quadriplegia after about age five years, often eventually causing breathing difficulties. In Martsolf syndrome infantile hypotonia is followed primarily by slowly progressive lower-limb spasticity. Hypogonadism – when present – manifests in both syndromes, in males as micropenis and/or cryptorchidism and in females as hypoplastic labia minora, clitoral hypoplasia, and small introitus.

GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency encompasses a spectrum of disease that includes autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms, with severity correlating with the residual enzyme activity. Individuals who are heterozygous for pathogenic variants in GCH1 have symptoms ranging from none (due to reduced penetrance) to dopa-responsive dystonia, which is the most common presentation in symptomatic cases, to rarer neurological presentations such as adult-onset \benign\"" parkinsonism, various types of focal dystonia, and symptoms simulating cerebral palsy or spastic paraplegia. Hyperphenylalaninemia is absent, and patients respond well to treatment with levodopa. Individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for pathogenic variants in GCH1 typically present with hyperphenylalaninemia, often identified by newborn screening, and severe neurological features and due to very low or undetectable enzyme activity. Treatment with levodopa, BH4, and 5-hydroxytryptophan can improve the symptoms but does not prevent development of severe encephalopathy.

Medical problems including heart defects, seizures, undescended testicle, and an inguinal hernia have also been reported in some affected individuals. Researchers have identified five regions of the X chromosome that are linked to FG syndrome in affected families. Mutations in the MED12 gene appears to be the most common cause of this disorder, leading to FG syndrome 1. Other genes involved with FG syndrome include FLNA (FGS2), CASK (FGS4), UPF3B (FGS6), and BRWD3 (FGS7).FGS is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.Individualized early intervention and educational services are important so that each child can reach their fullest potential.

MONDO:0013343	C1Q deficiency	C1q deficiency is a rare disorder associated with recurrent skin lesions, chronic infections, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or SLE-like diseases. It has also been associated with a kidney disease known as mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. C1q is a complex and together with other proteins, C1r and C1s, it forms the C1 complex. This complex is important for the activation of the complement system (a group of proteins that work with the immune system). It also disposes cells that are dead. C1q deficiency presents in 2 different forms, absent C1q protein or abnormal C1q protein. Symptoms include infections (ear infections (otitis media), meningitis, urinary tract infections, oral infections); skin lesions (small blisters (vesicles), dark patches, and atrophic areas) that get worse upon light exposure; cataracts; loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, and scalp hair; blood in urine; and glomerulonephritis. About 93% of cases are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It can be caused by mutations in the C1QA, C1QB or C1QC genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment depends on the symptoms. Recently, it was shown that C1q production can be restored by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a procedure in which a person receives blood-forming stem cells (cells from which all blood cells develop) from a genetically similar, but not identical donor.
