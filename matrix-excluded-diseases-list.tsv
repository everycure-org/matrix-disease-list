Four types have been defined: Type I (PPD1 or biphalangeal thumb polydactyly) which shows duplication of one or more skeletal components of a biphalangeal thumb; type II (PPD2 or polydactyly of a triphalangeal thumb) which involves the presence of a usually opposable triphalangeal thumb with or without additional duplication of thumb; type III (PPD3 or polydactyly of an index finger) where the thumb is replaced by one or two triphalangeal digits with dermatoglyphic pattern specific for the index finger; and type IV (PPD4 or polysyndactyly) which shows variably mild degrees of thumb duplication and variable syndactyly between 3rd and 4th fingers. Among the four types, PPD1 is the most frequent form. Preaxial polydactyly of fingers is caused by disruptions to the developmental patterning of the limb along the anterior-posterior axis that lead to changes in digit number and identity.	preaxial polydactyly of hand	mondo:gard_rare, mondo:disease_grouping, mondo:rare, mondo:otar

Because of the variation in clinical presentation and a lack of a specific diagnostic finding on histopathology, a uniformly accepted definition of parapsoriasis remains lacking. There are 2 general forms: a small plaque type, which is usually benign, and a large plaque type, which is a precursor of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).Treatment of small plaque parapsoriasis is unnecessary but can include emollients, topical tar preparations or corticosteroids, and/or phototherapy.

MONDO:0700247	RAB18 deficiency	Group of diseases encompassing a spectrum of disorders characterized by Warburg Micro Syndrome (characterized by eye, nervous system, and endocrine abnormalities) and Martsolf Syndrome phenotypes (characterized by similar – but milder – findings). To date Warburg micro syndrome comprises 96% of reported individuals with genetically defined RAB18 deficiency. The hallmark ophthalmologic findings are bilateral congenital cataracts, usually accompanied by microphthalmia, microcornea (diameter <10), and small atonic pupils. Poor vision despite early cataract surgery likely results from progressive optic atrophy and cortical visual impairment. Individuals with Warburg micro syndrome have severe to profound intellectual disability (ID); those with Martsolf syndrome have mild to moderate ID. Some individuals with RAB18 deficiency also have epilepsy. In Warburg micro syndrome, a progressive ascending spastic paraplegia typically begins with spastic diplegia and contractures during the first year, followed by upper-limb involvement leading to spastic quadriplegia after about age five years, often eventually causing breathing difficulties. In Martsolf syndrome infantile hypotonia is followed primarily by slowly progressive lower-limb spasticity. Hypogonadism – when present – manifests in both syndromes, in males as micropenis and/or cryptorchidism and in females as hypoplastic labia minora, clitoral hypoplasia, and small introitus.
