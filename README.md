# MATRIX disease list

The MATRIX disease list seeks to filter the set of all diseases and their categories to those that can be specifically targeted by a drug.
It is developed in particular for the [MATRIX project](https://everycure.org/every-cure-to-receive-48-3m-from-arpa-h-to-develop-ai-driven-platform-to-revolutionize-future-of-drug-development-and-repurposing/), but openly available to everyone.
