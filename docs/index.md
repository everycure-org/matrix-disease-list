## MATRIX disease list documentation

The goal of the MATRIX project is to develop strong candidate suggestions for drug repurposing (see [here for a press release](https://everycure.org/every-cure-to-receive-48-3m-from-arpa-h-to-develop-ai-driven-platform-to-revolutionize-future-of-drug-development-and-repurposing/)).

The MATRIX disease list is an effort to construct a list diseases that that can be targeted by drugs.
Many disease terminologies contain diseases that are either disease groupings (such as "hereditary disease" or "cancer") which are too broad to be specifically considered to be targetable by drugs, or diseases that are so specific that they dont have any differentiable criteria relevant to their treatment procedures.
The goal of the MATRIX disease list is, therefore, to separate these cases from "drug-targetable diseases".

The list will be used for communication and navigation purposes
