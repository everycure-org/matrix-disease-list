    label_manual_comment: "ChEBI is an essential foundation for biomedical informatics\
      \ because it provides a rigorously curated ontology of small molecules, drugs,\
      \ metabolites, cofactors, and xenobiotics, each linked with standardized identifiers\
      \ (InChI, SMILES, INNs, synonyms) and roles such as \u201Cantineoplastic agent\u201D\
      \ or \u201Canalgesic.\u201D From a pharmacology perspective, this makes it an\
      \ amazing source for harmonizing chemical vocabularies across databases and\
      \ for ensuring consistent mapping of drug entities when integrating resources\
      \ like ChEMBL, DrugBank, or Reactome. However, ChEBI does not itself provide\
      \ direct therapeutic relationships such as drug\u2013target, target\u2013disease,\
      \ or drug\u2013disease edges. Its value in repurposing therefore lies in its\
      \ ability to unify chemical definitions, facilitate cross-resource linkage,\
      \ and provide chemical role annotations that can serve as indirect signals of\
      \ therapeutic potential. In practice, ChEBI acts as the chemical backbone of\
      \ larger repurposing pipelines, enabling clean integration rather than producing\
      \ repurposing hypotheses on its own"

      \ from multiple evidence streams \u2014 curated resources, GWAS, and large-scale\
      \ text mining. From a therapeutic perspective, this makes it a powerful backbone\
      \ for connecting disease biology to molecular targets, especially since all\
      \ entities are mapped to standardized identifiers (Disease Ontology, UniProt,\
      \ HGNC, Ensembl). The built-in confidence scoring (1\u20135 stars) and benchmarking\
      \ against gold standards lend reliability that is rare in large-scale association\
      \ resources. For drug repurposing, DISEASES does not provide drug\u2013disease\
      \ edges directly, but it plays a crucial enabling role: drugs can be linked\
      \ in through their known targets (via resources like DrugBank or ChEMBL), making\
      \ D\u2192T\u2192D inference feasible at scale. This indirect but evidence-weighted\
      \ connection between disease and targets provides a structured way to prioritize\
      \ repurposing opportunities grounded in genetic and literature support. It is\
      \ not a plug-and-play repurposing tool on its own, but it is an excellent, trustworthy\
      \ foundation for building disease\u2013gene\u2013drug networks that support\

    description: DrugMechDB is a curated database that captures mechanistic paths
      from a drug to a disease within a given indication. Expert curators normalize
      concepts and relationships to standard biomedical identifiers and represent
      each indication as a directed path through a biological knowledge graph, suitable
      for computational analysis and benchmarking.

      \ epigenetic, and imaging assays. From a pharmacology standpoint, this resource\
      \ provides a unique way to understand mechanism of action, pathway involvement,\
      \ and potential off-target or toxic effects. While LINCS does not natively contain\
      \ curated drug\u2013target or drug\u2013disease links, its large-scale perturbation\
      \ signatures [molecular response profile of a cell when it is exposed to a specific\
      \ perturbation (e.g., a small molecule, genetic knockdown, overexpression, or\
      \ other intervention)] serve as a critical hypothesis-generation layer. By integrating\
      \ LINCS with drug\u2013target resources (e.g., DrugBank, ChEMBL) and disease\
      \ ontologies, one can systematically prioritize candidate therapies, explore\
      \ polypharmacology, and filter out compounds with toxicity"

    - comment: The license apparently uses language to declare something similar to
        "public domain", but with the caveat that it may contain data that is otherwise.
        This is judged to be a violation as any (re)use would depend on negotiating
        with all upstream copyright holders, which are not presented. It is implied
        that their license does not cover all data and could not find an explicit
        "clean" version of the data in the downloads.

    label_manual_comment: "SemMedDB is a valuable pharmacology-facing resource because\
      \ it systematically mines the biomedical literature to surface relationships\
      \ among drugs, targets, and diseases. For pharmacology and repurposing work,\
      \ this means one can quickly identify broad patterns of how drugs are reported\
      \ to treat conditions, inhibit targets, or interact with biological processes\
      \ across the entire PubMed corpus. The use of UMLS CUIs ensures standardized\
      \ identifiers and allows integration with other biomedical datasets. However,\
      \ because the relationships are automatically extracted via NLP rather than\
      \ manually curated, there is considerable noise, and predicates are often generic.\
      \ As a result, SemMedDB is best positioned as a hypothesis-generation tool rather\
      \ than a plug-and-play backbone for drug\u2013disease modeling. With careful\
      \ filtering around higher-confidence predicates (e.g., TREATS, INHIBITS) and\

    label_manual_comment: "STRING is highly relevant for repurposing and translational\
      \ pharmacology because it captures the functional protein landscape that underlies\
      \ drug action. By linking proteins in pathways, networks, and disease processes,\
      \ it enables inference of indirect drug\u2013disease relationships. The layered\
      \ evidence and confidence scoring help distinguish biologically meaningful interactions\
      \ from background noise, which is essential for pharmacology-driven hypotheses.\
      \ Since drugs act through proteins, STRING provides the mechanistic bridge between\
      \ drug targets and downstream phenotypes, making it a great source for evaluating\
      \ new therapeutic opportunities"
